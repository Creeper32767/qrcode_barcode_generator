## About The Project

**QR & Barcode Generator** is a Python-based application that simplifies the creation and decoding of various 1D and 2D codes. Whether you need to generate a QR code for a URL, a product barcode for inventory, or analyze an existing code from an image, this tool provides a straightforward solution.

### Built With

This project relies on a set of powerful open-source libraries:

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/)
*   [qrcode](https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode) (for QR Code generation)
*   [python-barcode](https://github.com/WhyNotHugo/python-barcode) (for standard barcode generation)
*   [pyzbar](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/pyzbar) (for code analysis and decoding)
*   [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) (for image processing)
*   [Colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama) (for colored terminal output)

## Features

*   **Generate QR Codes:** Quickly create QR codes from any text or data.
*   **Generate Barcodes:** Supports a wide variety of standard barcode formats, including EAN-13, Code128, and more.
*   **Analyze Codes:** Decode QR codes and barcodes directly from image files to retrieve their embedded data.
*   **Save & Export:** Save your generated codes as image files for use in other applications.

## Getting Started
